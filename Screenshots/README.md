**sentosa_old_output.png** describes the problem with my previous Homography implementation
**sentosa_new_output.png** describes my Affine implementation
**sentosa_output_cylindrical.png** describes my experiment with warping the input frames to cylinders before Affine transformation, which should result in a better mapping
**output_cylindrical_proper.png** describes the proper way to stitch with Affine, by stitching many short cylindrical segments. I may try segmenting the two videos.
